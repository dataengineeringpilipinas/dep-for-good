# DEP for Good

DEP for Good is an initiative to support NGOs, government agencies, religious organizations, educational institutions, community centers, health organizations, social enterprises, and local businesses.

This initiative will not only address these groups' data-driven solution needs but also create a safe environment for beginners to practice and enhance their newly acquired skills while mimicking real-world industry best practices.
